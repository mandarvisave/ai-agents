    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're likely referring to the **second development I mentioned in my previous answer: \"Molecule Generation and Design\"**, which is a cornerstone of AI's impact on drug discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me elaborate on this fascinating area:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Molecule Generation and Design: The AI-Powered \"Molecular Architects\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditionally, drug discovery involved two main approaches:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Screening Existing Libraries:** Taking vast collections of pre-made chemical compounds and testing them against a specific biological target to see if any bind effectively. This is like looking for a needle in a haystack.\n",
      "2.  **Rational Design (based on human expertise):** Scientists use their knowledge of chemistry and biology to design molecules with specific properties. This is highly skilled but can be slow and limited by human intuition.\n",
      "\n",
      "AI is revolutionizing this by enabling **de novo (from scratch) molecule generation and sophisticated predictive design.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how it works and why it's a major development:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. De Novo Molecule Generation (Designing Truly Novel Molecules):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What it is:** AI models can create entirely new chemical structures that have never existed before. They aren't just modifying existing drugs; they are designing them from the ground up based on desired characteristics.\n",
      "*   **How it's done:**\n",
      "    *   **Generative Models:** Techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), along with more recent transformer-based models, are trained on massive datasets of known molecules and their properties.\n",
      "    *   **Learning the Rules of Chemistry:** These models learn the underlying \"rules\" of how atoms bond, how molecules fold, and what properties arise from different structures.\n",
      "    *   **Goal-Directed Generation:** Researchers provide the AI with specific criteria, such as:\n",
      "        *   **Target Binding:** \"Design a molecule that strongly binds to protein X.\"\n",
      "        *   **Desired Properties:** \"Ensure it's soluble in water, has low toxicity, and can cross the blood-brain barrier.\"\n",
      "        *   **Synthesizability:** \"Make sure it's a molecule that can actually be synthesized in a lab.\"\n",
      "    *   **The Output:** The AI then proposes a list of novel molecular structures that are predicted to meet these requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Predictive Modeling for Efficacy and Safety (Intelligent Filtering and Optimization):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What it is:** Even before a molecule is synthesized, AI can predict its likely behavior in biological systems.\n",
      "*   **How it's done:**\n",
      "    *   **Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR):** AI builds complex models that correlate a molecule's chemical structure with its biological activity or properties.\n",
      "    *   **ADMET Prediction:** AI predicts:\n",
      "        *   **Absorption:** How well it gets into the body.\n",
      "        *   **Distribution:** Where it goes in the body.\n",
      "        *   **Metabolism:** How the body breaks it down.\n",
      "        *   **Excretion:** How it leaves the body.\n",
      "        *   **Toxicity:** Potential harmful effects.\n",
      "    *   **Virtual Screening:** Instead of physically testing millions of compounds, AI can virtually \"screen\" billions of potential molecules (including those it generated) to identify the most promising ones for further, more expensive testing.\n",
      "    *   **Optimizing Lead Compounds:** If an initial molecule shows some promise (a \"lead compound\"), AI can help refine its structure to improve its efficacy, reduce side effects, or enhance its pharmacokinetic properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is this a \"New Development\" and so significant?**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Unprecedented Speed:** AI can explore chemical space and predict properties orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods. What used to take years can now potentially take months or even weeks.\n",
      "*   **Novelty and Innovation:** AI can discover molecules with entirely new scaffolds and mechanisms of action that human chemists might not have conceived of. This is crucial for tackling diseases with limited treatment options or overcoming drug resistance.\n",
      "*   **Reduced Costs:** By filtering out many non-viable candidates early on, AI significantly reduces the number of compounds that need to be synthesized and tested experimentally, saving immense amounts of money and resources.\n",
      "*   **Personalized Medicine:** As AI gets better at predicting individual responses, it opens doors for designing drugs tailored to specific genetic profiles or disease subtypes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In essence, AI is transforming drug discovery from a laborious, trial-and-error process into a more intelligent, predictive, and design-driven endeavor.** It's empowering scientists to explore a much larger universe of potential medicines and to do so with greater efficiency and success.\n",
